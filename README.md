# Filters Library for Arduino

A versatile filtering library for Arduino that provides a set of tools for signal processing, including moving average, low-pass, high-pass, threshold, and Kalman filters.

## Features

- **Moving Average Filter**: Smoothens input signals by averaging a dynamic-sized buffer.
- **Low-Pass Filter**: Removes high-frequency noise from signals.
- **High-Pass Filter**: Highlights rapid changes in signals.
- **Threshold Filter**: Detects values exceeding a specified threshold.
- **Kalman Filter**: Provides an optimal estimate for noisy 1D measurements.
